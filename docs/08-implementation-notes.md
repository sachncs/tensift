## Overview

This document catalogs known simplifications and limitations in the tensift implementation. These are not bugs per se, but conscious design choices or areas where the implementation could be extended. Understanding these limitations is important for interpreting results and planning improvements.

---

## Simplified MPO Representation

**Location**: `crates/tensift-tensor/src/opes.rs` — `MatrixProductOperator::from_hamiltonian`

**Current behavior**: The MPO is constructed as a nearest-neighbor identity-like structure with dummy local energy terms (0.1 for off-diagonal). It does **not** encode the actual CVP Hamiltonian structure.

**Impact**: Spectral amplification estimates a ground-state energy from the MPO norm, but the amplified distribution does not directly reflect the true CVP energy landscape. The `sample_amplified_mpo` function uses the estimated $E_0$ to shift energies, not to contract the full amplified MPO.

**Potential improvement**: Implement a proper MPO decomposition of the CVP Hamiltonian, capturing the full $J_{ij}$ coupling structure.

---

## Custom Power-Iteration SVD

**Location**: `crates/tensift-tensor/src/opes.rs` — `MatrixProductOperator::truncate_tensor`

**Current behavior**: Truncation uses 3 fixed iterations of power iteration on the Gram matrix, not a true SVD or randomized SVD.

**Comment from source**:  
"3 fixed iterations from a random start are sufficient for truncation quality. If higher precision is needed, increase this count or switch to a Lanczos/QR-based eigensolver."

**Impact**: For well-conditioned matrices, 3 iterations are sufficient. For ill-conditioned matrices, truncation quality may degrade.

**Potential improvement**: Use `ndarray-linalg` or a dedicated SVD library for proper singular value decomposition.

---

## Segment LLL Parallelization

**Location**: `crates/tensift-lattice/src/segment_lll.rs`

**Current behavior**: The `parallel_local_lll` function processes even-indexed segments sequentially, then odd-indexed segments sequentially. The comment states:

"The current implementation processes segments sequentially... A truly parallel version would require splitting the matrix into disjoint mutable views."

**Impact**: Segment LLL does not achieve the theoretical $O(n^3 \log n \log B / p)$ speedup. It is effectively sequential with even/odd scheduling for memory safety.

**Potential improvement**: Use `rayon` with scoped threads or split the basis matrix into independent mutable chunks.

---

## BKZ Enumeration

**Location**: `crates/tensift-lattice/src/bkz.rs`

**Current behavior**:
- For blocks $\beta \leq 3$: tries all coefficient combinations in $[-2, 2]$
- For larger blocks: greedy branch-and-bound trying single vectors and pairs ($\pm 1$)

**Impact**: BKZ does not perform full enumeration for blocks $\beta > 3$. The quality improvement per tour is limited compared to a full BKZ implementation.

**Potential improvement**: Implement full branch-and-bound enumeration with pruning, or integrate a production BKZ library.

---

## Adaptive Bond Resizing

**Location**: `crates/tensift-tensor/src/ttn.rs` — `TreeTensorNetwork::resize_bond`

**Current behavior**: `resize_bond` updates the `bond_dim` field on the node and the `BondInfo` struct, but **does not resize the actual `ndarray` tensor data**.

**Impact**: When adaptive bond dimensions are enabled, the metadata changes but the tensor shapes remain unchanged. The TTN continues to use the original bond dimension for contractions.

**Potential improvement**: Implement proper tensor resizing with padding or SVD truncation.

---

## Klein Sampling Fallback

**Location**: `crates/tensift-lattice/src/babai.rs` — `sample_discrete_gaussian`

**Current behavior**: If rejection sampling fails 1000 times, the algorithm falls back to `safe_round_to_i64(center)`.

**Comment from source**:  
"The fallback slightly alters the exact discrete-Gaussian distribution but ensures the algorithm always terminates."

**Impact**: In high dimensions or with very narrow Gaussians, the fallback may dominate, reducing the stochastic exploration benefit.

**Potential improvement**: Use a more sophisticated discrete Gaussian sampler (e.g., convolution-based or alias method).

---

## TTN Leaf Optimization

**Location**: `crates/tensift-tensor/src/ttn.rs` — `TreeTensorNetwork::optimize_leaf`

**Current behavior**: Gradients are computed by finite differences with $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$:
```rust
grad = (H(z_j = 1) - H(z_j = 0)) / (2 * epsilon)
```

**Impact**: $O(\text{bond_dim} \cdot n)$ energy evaluations per sweep step. This is significantly slower than analytical gradients, which would require only $O(1)$ additional contraction work per tensor.

**Potential improvement**: Derive and implement analytical gradients for TTN leaf tensors.

---

## OPES Partition Function

**Location**: `crates/tensift-tensor/src/opes.rs` — `OpesSampler::estimate_partition_function`

**Current behavior**:
- Uses 100 random samples
- For $n < 60$: scales by $2^n / 100$
- For $n \geq 60$: returns `total * 100.0`

**Impact**: The partition function estimate is crude, especially for $n \geq 60$. OPES probability normalization is approximate.

**Potential improvement**: Use importance sampling or a more sophisticated Monte Carlo estimate.

---

## Index Slicing Terminology

**Location**: `crates/tensift-algebra/src/factor.rs` — `sample_with_index_slicing`

**Current behavior**: The function name "index slicing" refers to parallel evaluation of candidate configurations across threads, not slicing of tensor contraction indices. The `SliceConfig` is used to partition the candidate list, not the bond dimension.

**Note**: Earlier versions implemented actual bond-dimension slicing in `ttn.rs` via `contract_node_parallel`; that path was removed in the 0.1.1 refactor. "Index slicing" now refers solely to parallel candidate evaluation in the factor pipeline.

**Impact**: The name is historical; no tensor bond slicing exists in the current codebase.

---

## Weighted Topology Construction

**Location**: `crates/tensift-tensor/src/ttn.rs` — `build_from_cluster_tree`

**Current behavior**: The cluster tree construction only processes the first two children per merge when creating internal nodes. If a cluster has more than two children, additional children are ignored.

**Impact**: The weighted topology may not fully reflect the cluster hierarchy for merges involving more than two sub-clusters.

**Potential improvement**: Generalize to $k$-ary trees or enforce binary merges throughout the clustering algorithm.

---

## Zero TODOs and FIXMEs

The codebase contains **no TODO or FIXME comments**. While this indicates a clean initial implementation, it also means there is no explicit technical debt tracking. The items in this document serve as a substitute.
